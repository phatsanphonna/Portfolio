        <Paragraph>
          I am a guy that like to do things differently. It feels outstanding.
          The difference that I think is not common is "I'm left-handed" It's pretty normal,
          but you know, It make my life harder than normal. Especially doing the exam on the lecture table.
          That's hell, And one more thing is I'm an English - Chinese student,
          but I want to study in the computer related things. So weird, isn't it?
          English - Chinese student wants to study in Science related things.
          But just a little late to decide. It's not wrong. you know?
