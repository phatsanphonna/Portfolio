          All of my works came from the fact that I have learned the subject called "Technology Design" In the fifth grade
          It is a course that allows to try to write a program. Then I really enjoyed it. I can build anything that I want to create.
          For example, write a simple program to rename the file name in the same way, so I try to study coding with myself.
          and feel very fun. I can do it without bored. So I want this area to be a space for displaying my little works.
